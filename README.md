# PixelyEngine
A pixel based high level game engine.

This game engine is based off of Java's idea, which is build once, run anywhere... or something like that.
This is intended to be supported to run on any frame.
Here we try to keep things as generic as possible. We take no shortcuts.


#### If you want to contribute to this project, I suggest to know a basic understanding of Java, and Java's reflection system.
### I'm not an expert myself, so any support would be highly appreciated.
