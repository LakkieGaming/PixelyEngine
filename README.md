# PixelyEngine
A pixel based high level game engine.

This game engine is based off of Java's idea, which is build once, run anywhere... or something like that.
This is intended to be supported to run on any frame.
Here we try to keep things as generic as possible. We take no shortcuts.


*If you want to contribute to this project, I suggest to know an understanding of Java, and game development.*
### I'm not an expert myself, so any support would be highly appreciated.
